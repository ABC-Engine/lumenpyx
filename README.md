<h2 align="center"> A unique 2D-pixel art renderer with heightmaps to simulate 3d shadows. </h2>

# Examples
This is the best example I have for now, the renderer is capable of much more than this, but I'm not a great artist.

# Compatibility
Because of the use of the Winit crate, this library is currently Windows only.

# Re-Exports
I re-export the Winit crate because it is necessary for window management.

# Getting Started
You can find the crate [here](https://crates.io/crates/lumenpyx) and download it using ```cargo add lumenpyx```. Check out [the discord](https://discord.gg/55R3GsBSYC), we've got a help channel. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ABC-Engine/lumenpyx/wiki), the docs for this library are kept there. I will keep updated as time goes on. If there is anything that you would like a docs page for let me know!
